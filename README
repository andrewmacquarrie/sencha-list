Sencha Touch experiment with source and list.

This example is in coffeescript.

To get the example working you need to download the Sencha Touch 2 SDK, rename the folder to "touch" and place it in the root of the project.

To compile the coffeescript into javascript, run
  > coffee -o app -cb src

During development, it's a good idea to have coffeescript continually compiling into javascript by watching the coffeescript files for changes:
  > coffee -o app -cbw src
  
I use bare compilation which removes the top level function wrapper.
